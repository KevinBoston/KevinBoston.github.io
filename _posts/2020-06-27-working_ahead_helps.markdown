I spend a lot of time developing my programming chops before being accepted to FlatIron. I mostly completed the bootcamp prep course and took several additional online classes to ensure I was ready. 

I know that my learning style is slow and steady. I like to practice and feel like I've mastered concepts, so I planned ahead and got myself to a point where I felt ready to start the program. 

In the end, the best advice is to know how you learn and make sure you give yourself time to learn what you need.
