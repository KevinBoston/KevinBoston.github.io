Starting a new career requires playing to your strengths and to your goals; software development allows me to engage with my interest in problem solving and communications while helping me to grow both personally and professionally. Career assessments going back as far as high school have suggested that software engineering is the place for me, but at the time my interests too me elsewhere. I began my career in communications, but consistently wanted more opportunities to problem solve individually and as part of a team. I started teaching myself programming in my free time, and knew that I had found what I was looking for - the opportunity to apply my creativity and critical thinking to a task that is measurable and with results that are concrete.


I have found my time learning software development enjoyable so far, both for the self-improvement of learning programming languages and logic and for the solving of problems with the languages. I like that the field of software development offers the chance to learn new, specialized languages to solve particular problems and hope to continue revisiting the learning cycle as part of a career in software engineering.
